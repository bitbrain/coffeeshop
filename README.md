## Introduction

Welcome to **CoffeeShop** - we offer freshly brewed coffee, cakes and delicious sandwiches. Demand grew a lot which made us move into the cloud. Our architecture allows us to take orders online via an API, we store our orders and can present them to our employees.

## Project Structure

This project consists of the following folders:

* `api/` - the frontend API component to serve requests from shops and clients
* `orderbook/` - the order component of the system
* `catalogue/` - the product catalogue of the coffeeshop
* `infrastructure/` - the infrastructure required, for example a `MongoDB` database, running via `docker-compose`.

Additionally, this project contains the following files:

* `start-coffeeshop.sh` - starts the entire coffeeshop in a local Kubernetes cluster
